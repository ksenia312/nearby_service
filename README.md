Nearby Service Flutter Plugin is used to create connections in a P2P network.
The plugin supports sending text messages and files. With it,
you can easily create any kind of information sharing application **without Internet connection**.

The package does not support communication between Android and IOS devices, the connection is available for
**Android-Android** and **IOS-IOS** relations.

Your feedback and suggestions would be greatly
appreciated! [You can leave your opinion here](https://forms.gle/FbAtW2dG5RYCxb1DA)

## About

> A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a decentralized network architecture in which each participant, called a peer, can act
> as both a client and a server. This means that peer-to-peer networks can exchange resources such as files, data or
> services directly with each other without needing a central authority or server.

### About Android Plugin

For Android, **Wi-fi Direct** is used as a P2P network.

It is implemented through the `android.net.wifi.p2p` module.
It **requires** permissions for `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` (for Android 13+).

It is also important that you need **Wi-fi enabled** on your device to use it.

To check permissions and Wi-fi status, the
`nearby_service` plugin includes a set of methods:

- `checkWifiService()` (Android only): returns true if Wi-fi is enabled
- `requestPermissions()` (Android only): requests permissions for location and nearby devices and returns true if
  granted
- `openServicesSettings()`: opens Wi-fi settings for Android and general settings for iOS

> Testing the plugin **is not possible** on Android emulators, as they usually do not contain the Wi-fi Direct function
> in general! Use physical devices for that.

### About IOS Plugin

For IOS, the P2P connection is implemented through the `Multipeer Connectivity` framework.

This framework **automatically selects** the best network technology depending on the situationâ€”using **Wi-Fi**
if both devices are on the same network, or using **peer-to-peer Wi-Fi** or **Bluetooth** otherwise.

The module will work even with Wi-fi turned off (via Bluetooth), but you can still use `openServicesSettings()` from
the `nearby_service` plugin to open the settings and prompt the user to turn Wi-fi on.

## Features

- **Device Preparation**
    - Requesting permissions to use Wi-Fi Direct (Android only)
    - Checking Wi-Fi status (Android only)
    - Opening settings to enable Wi-Fi (Android and iOS)
    - Role selection - Browser or Advertiser (IOS only)

- **Connecting to the Device from a P2P Network**
    - Listening for discovered devices (peers)
    - Creating connections over the P2P network
    - Monitoring the status of the connected device

- **The Data Transmission Channel**
    - Establishing the channel for data exchange
    - Monitoring the status of the channel

- **Typed Data Exchange**
    - Transmitting text data over the P2P network
    - Receiving confirmation of successful text message delivery
    - Transmitting files over the P2P network
    - The option to confirm or deny receiving of files over the network

## Setup

### Android setup

All necessary Android permissions are already in the **AndroidManifest.xml** of the plugin,
so you don't need to add anything **to work with p2p network**.

### IOS setup

For IOS, you need to add the following values to **Info.plist**:

```
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
  <array>
    <string>_mp-connection._tcp</string>
  </array>
<key>UIRequiresPersistentWiFi</key>
<true/>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>[Your description here]</string>
```

- `NSBonjourServices`

  For the `nearby_service` plugin, you should add the value `<string>_mp-connection._tcp</string>`. This key is
  required for **Multipeer Connectivity**. It defines the Bonjour services
  that your application will look for. Bonjour is Apple's implementation of zero-configuration networking, which allows
  devices on a LAN to discover each other and establish connections without requiring manual configuration.

- `UIRequiresPersistentWiFi`

  This key is not strictly required for **Multipeer Connectivity** to work. This key is used
  to indicate that your application requires a persistent Wi-Fi connection even when the screen is off. This can be
  useful for maintaining a network connection for continuous data transfer.

- `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`

  This key is needed to inform users why your application will use the local network. You must provide a string value
  that explains why your application needs LAN access.

> Note that if you want to use the plugin **to send files**, you also need to follow the instructions about permissions
> of the filesystem management package you are using.

## Usage

> The full example demonstrating the functionality can be viewed at
> the [link](https://github.com/ksenia312/nearby_service/tree/main/example_full).

> **Important note:** for functionality that is only available for one of the platforms, you should use the
> corresponding
> API element from `NearbyService`.
>
> For Android:
>
> ```dart
> final _nearbyService = NearbyService.getInstance();
> _nearbyService.android..
> ```
> For IOS:
>
> ```dart
> final _nearbyService = NearbyService.getInstance();
> _nearbyService.ios..
> ```

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:nearby_service/nearby_service.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of NearbyService:

```dart
// getInstance() returns an instance for the current platform.
final _nearbyService = NearbyService.getInstance();
```

3. Initialize the plugin:

```dart
// You can change the device name on a P2P network only for iOS. 
// Optionally pass the [iosDeviceName].
await _nearbyService.initialize(
        data: NearbyInitializeData(iosDeviceName: iosDeviceName),
      );
```

**Extra step for Android:** ask for permissions and make sure Wi-fi is enabled:

```dart
final granted = await _nearbyService.android?.requestPermissions();
if (granted ?? false) {
  // go to the checking Wi-fi step
}
```

```dart
final isWifiEnabled = await _nearbyService.android?.checkWifiService();
if (isWifiEnabled ?? false) {
  // go to the starting discovery step
}
```

**Extra step for IOS:** ask the user to choose whether they are a Browser or Advertiser:

> In IOS Multipeer Connectivity, there are 2 roles for the discovery process and connection between devices: **browser**
> and **advertiser**.
>
> **Browser**: This component discovers nearby devices that report their availability. It is
> responsible for finding peers that advertise themselves and inviting them to join the shared session.
>
> **Advertiser**: This component advertises the availability of the device to nearby peers. It is used to let know
> the browser that the device is available for inviting and connecting.

The code for selecting a role:

```dart
_nearbyService.ios?.setIsBrowser(value: isBrowser);
// go to the starting discovery step
```

4. Start to discover the P2P network.

```dart
final result = await _nearbyService.discover();
if (result) {
   // go to the listening peers step
}
```

5. Start listening to peers:

```dart
_nearbyService.getPeersStream().listen((event) => peers = event);
```

6. Each of the peers is a `NearbyDevice` and you can connect to it:

> Remember that when used on the Android platform, you can only pass `NearbyAndroidDevice` to the `connect()` method.
> Similarly for iOS, `NearbyIOSDevice`. Devices automatically come from the discovery state in the correct type, so you
> just need to use the received data.

```dart
final result = await _nearbyService.connect(device);
if (result) {
  // go the the listening the device step
}
```

7. Once you are connected via P2P network, you can start listening to the connected device. If `null` comes from the
   stream, it means the devices lost connection.

```dart
_connectedDeviceSubscription = _nearbyService.getConnectedDeviceStream(device).listen(
  (event) async {
    final wasConnected = connectedDevice?.status.isConnected ?? false;
    final nowConnected = event?.status.isConnected ?? false;
    if (wasConnected && !nowConnected) {
      // return to the discovery state
    }
    connectedDevice = event;
  },
);
```

8. Once you have connected over a P2P network, you still need to create a **communication channel** to transfer data.
   For Android, this is a **socket** embedded in `NearbyService`, for iOS it's a setup to listen to messages and
   resources from the desired device. There is a method `startCommunicationChannel()` for this purpose. You should pass
   to it listeners for messages and resources received from the connected device. There can only be one communication
   channel, if you create a new one, the previous one will be **cancelled**.

```dart
final messagesListener = NearbyServiceMessagesListener(
  onData: (message) {
    // handle the message from NearbyServiceMessagesListener
  },
);
final filesListener = NearbyServiceFilesListener(
  onData: (pack) async {
    // handle the files pack from NearbyServiceFilesListener
  }, 
);

await _nearbyService.startCommunicationChannel(
  NearbyCommunicationChannelData(
    connectedDevice.info.id,
    messagesListener: messagesListener,
    filesListener: filesListener,
  ),
);
```

9. I think you've already guessed that since there are listeners of messages from another device, we can send them
   ourselves too :) There is a method `send()` for that:

```dart
_nearbyService.send(
  OutgoingNearbyMessage(
    content: NearbyMessageTextRequest.create(value: message),
    receiver: connectedDevice.info,
  ),
);
```

## Data sharing

This is a very important topic for the `nearby_service` plugin because it provides unique functionality for sharing
typed data.

First, it's essential to say that when you send a message, you are required to pass the `OutgoingNearbyMessage` model.
This contains the `receiver` - the recipient to whom the message is addressed. The receiver is someone with whom you
already have an established communication channel. Also `OutgoingNearbyMessage` contains a `content` field, it can be
one of 4 types:

- `NearbyMessageTextRequest`
- `NearbyMessageTextResponse`
- `NearbyMessageFilesRequest`
- `NearbyMessageFilesResponse`

We will talk more about them later.

Second, there is another type of message, `ReceivedNearbyMessage`. This is what comes to you from
the `NearbyServiceMessagesListener`. It contains a `sender` field so that you can identify who the message came from and
use that information.

### Text messages

Description of the operating logic:

1. One of the devices sends a message using the `send()` method:

```dart
// DEVICE A
_nearbyService.send(
  OutgoingNearbyMessage(
    content: NearbyMessageTextRequest.create(value: message),
    receiver: connectedDevice.info,
  ),
);
```

2. Another device receives the `ReceivedNearbyMessage` with content cast as `NearbyMessageTextRequest` from the
   `NearbyServiceMessagesListener`.

```dart
// DEVICE B
final messagesListener = NearbyServiceMessagesListener(
  onData: (message) {
    // message is ReceivedNearbyMessage with content cast as NearbyMessageTextRequest here
  },
);
```

3. If you want the sender to make sure the message has been received, you can send them `NearbyMessageTextResponse`. You
   need to add the `id` from the received `NearbyMessageTextRequest` to it:

```dart
// DEVICE B
_nearbyService.send(
  OutgoingNearbyMessage(
    receiver: connectedDevice.info,
    content: NearbyMessageTextResponse(id: requestId),
  ),
);
```

4. If everything is fine, the sender will receive your `NearbyMessageTextResponse` from
   their `NearbyServiceMessagesListener`:

```dart
// DEVICE A
final messagesListener = NearbyServiceMessagesListener(
  onData: (message) {
    // message is ReceivedNearbyMessage with content cast as NearbyMessageTextResponse here
  },
);
```

> Throughout the process, you can use the `id`s of the messages to identify them.

### Resource messages

Description of the operating logic:

1. One of the devices sends a message with `NearbyMessageFilesRequest` using the `send()` method:

```dart
// DEVICE A
_nearbyService.send(
  OutgoingNearbyMessage(
    // files here is List<NearbyFileInfo>, it can be easily created from the file path: NearbyFileInfo(path: file.path)
    content: NearbyMessageFilesRequest.create(files: files),
    receiver: connectedDevice.info,
  ),
);
```

2. Another device receives the `ReceivedNearbyMessage` with content cast as `NearbyMessageFilesRequest` from the
   `NearbyServiceMessagesListener`.

> The file request comes from the `NearbyServiceMessagesListener` because it doesn't contain the transferred files, only
> the request to send them! For files, confirmation by the other party before starting the data transfer is required!

```dart
// DEVICE B
final messagesListener = NearbyServiceMessagesListener(
  onData: (message) {
    // message is ReceivedNearbyMessage with content cast as NearbyMessageFilesRequest here
  },
);
```

3. In order to receive the files, the other party must confirm that it wants to do so and send a message
   with `NearbyMessageFilesResponse` content. The `NearbyMessageFilesResponse` contains the `isAccepted` field,
   which will determine whether the file sending will start or not.

> If you don't want to use confirmation logic to send files, just send the automatic positive responses
> to `NearbyMessageFilesRequest` in `NearbyServiceMessagesListener`.

```dart
// DEVICE B
_nearbyService.send(
  OutgoingNearbyMessage(
    receiver: connectedDevice!.info,
    content: NearbyMessageFilesResponse(
      id: request.id,
      isAccepted: isAccepted,
    ),
  ),
);
```

4. The sender will receive `NearbyMessageFilesResponse` in their `NearbyServiceMessagesListener` and can notify the
   user.

```dart
// DEVICE A
final messagesListener = NearbyServiceMessagesListener(
  onData: (message) {
    // message is ReceivedNearbyMessage with content cast as NearbyMessageFilesResponse here
  },
);
```

At this time under the hood, the sending of files will begin and the recipient will receive `ReceivedNearbyFilesPack` in
the `NearbyServiceFilesListener` when sending is complete. `ReceivedNearbyFilesPack` holds the paths of the received
files already stored on the device's temporary directory. You can overwrite them to the desired location, delete them,
or do anything else you like.

```dart
// DEVICE B
final filesListener = NearbyServiceFilesListener(
  onData: (pack) async {
  // pack is ReceivedNearbyFilesPack here
  },
);
```

## Exceptions

**NearbyService** includes custom errors that you can catch in your implementation.

**Common exceptions [See here](https://github.com/ksenia312/nearby_service/blob/main/lib/src/utils/exception.dart):**

- `NearbyServiceUnsupportedPlatformException`: Usage of the plugin on an unsupported platform
- `NearbyServiceUnsupportedDecodingException`: Error decoding messages from native platform to Dart (open an issue if
  this happens)
- `NearbyServiceInvalidMessageException`: An attempt to send an invalid message on the sender's side. Add content
  validation to your messages

**Exceptions that can be caught from the `discover()`, `stopDiscovery()`, `connect()`, and `disconnect()` methods for
the Android platform
[See here](https://github.com/ksenia312/nearby_service/blob/main/lib/src/platforms/android/utils/exception.dart):**

- `NearbyServiceBusyException`: The Wi-Fi P2P framework is currently busy. Usually this means that you have sent a
  request to some device and now one of the peers is **CONNECTING**
- `NearbyServiceP2PPUnsupportedException`: Wi-Fi P2P is not supported on this device
- `NearbyServiceNoServiceRequestsException`: No service discovery requests have been made. Ensure that you have
  initiated a service discovery request before attempting to connect
- `NearbyServiceGenericErrorException`: A generic error occurred. This could be due to various reasons such as hardware
  issues, Wi-Fi being turned off, or temporary issues with the Wi-Fi P2P framework
- `NearbyServiceUnknownException`: An unknown error occurred. Please check the device's Wi-Fi P2P settings and ensure
  the device supports Wi-Fi P2P

## Additional options

- Each `NearbyDevice` contains `NearbyDeviceInfo` that presents different meanings depending on the platform. For
  Android `id` is the MAC address of the device, and for iOS it is the unique identifier of its MCPeerID. In general, id
  identifies the device
  in its platform.
- Use the getter `communicationChannelState` of `NearbyService` to know the state of the communication channel. It may
  be:

    ```dart
    enum CommunicationChannelState {
      notConnected,
      loading,
      connected;
    
      bool get isNotConnected => this == CommunicationChannelState.notConnected;
    
      bool get isLoading => this == CommunicationChannelState.loading;
    
      bool get isConnected => this == CommunicationChannelState.connected;
    }
    ```

  The getter is `ValueListenable` so you can listen to its state.
- There are methods `getPlatformVersion()` and `getPlatformModel()` of `NearbyService` to determine the version and
  model of the device respectively. You can use them to specify a
  name for the IOS.
- Use `getCurrentDeviceInfo()` of `NearbyService` to get information about the current device on the P2P network. Note
  that the ID obtained from `getCurrentDeviceInfo()` for Android will always be **02:00:00:00:00:00** for privacy
  issues.
- For Android, it is possible to listen to the current state of the connection using
  method `getConnectionInfoStream` of `NearbyAndroidService`.
- When you are creating a service with `getInstance()`, you can define the logging level in the plugin using
  field `logLevel`.
  Possible logging levels:

  ```dart
  enum NearbyServiceLogLevel {
    debug,
    info,
    error,
    disabled,
  }
  ```
